## Highway-Simulation

This highway simulation software package is developed in Python. To run the simulation, make sure you are using Python 2, and have required packages (TkInter and Matplotlib) installed.

For the checkpoint implementation, all modules were written in separate scripts, and have been properly imported. All scripts are included in the codes folder. To run the model and visualize the results, first cd to the codes folder, then simply run the main.py script from command line using:
_python main.py_, or
_python2 main.py_ if you have multiple versions of python.

A sample demo is also included in the folder.
